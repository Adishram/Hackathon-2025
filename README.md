# Hackathon-2025
A financial aid web app with blockchain and ai integration
This is a web application project that won me an hackathon in my college.Its still not complete yet.
The idea of this app is to have a OAuth with google so only valid student can join.This can also be accessed by alumini students for helping out underprivileged students via donations which i will be integrating a blockchain wallet for it so that students can collect and alumin's can donate.
Iam using gemini's ai to list out all the grants provided by the government and an eligibility check that can tell you the odds of acceptance.
The dashboard is easy to keep track of deadline to applications and also to keep an eye on the application progress.
I also have integrated a way to send mail and sms notification of application project and also a firebase connection to upload documents and proofs directly to the web app so its easier to access all the documentsto submit for the application from the webapp.
I have used next.js for the techstack
i'll be working on completeing this project soon and will update the finished project
